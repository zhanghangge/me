TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
From this week's class, I've learnt a few basic techniques on how to use python by starting with solving some mathematical problems, it was pretty hard for me to coding cuz I haven't used it before, and there was also some tricky problems from the exercises.
The most useful functions that i've learnt for this week is about the if/elif/else func which i could simply use it for a range of problems for python and it was the basic logical techniques used in python . 
However, I still can't solve the loop questions but I found that for the loop ones we could use "for in" or "while in" commands. 
Also there was a bug in my python exercises which i still couldnt find out why is that there was a "type error" which occurred in my coding n I thought it was because that the  python dictionary has no things like "string". This is a very complicated issue which made me unable to finish the following questions from exercise 2 so I got stuck. 
 
 #week4 : I finally found out the problem of why I couldn't get mark from the exercises and I figured out the idea of for in loops and started to change some problems for the exercise.
