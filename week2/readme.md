__WEEK 2 :__

From this week's class, I've learnt a few basic techniques on how to use python by starting with solving some mathematical problems, it was pretty hard for me to coding because I haven't used it before, and there was also some tricky problems from the exercises such as the loop problems.

The most useful functions that I've learnt for this week is about the `<if/elif/else>` function which I could simply use it for a range of problems for python and it was the basic logical techniques used in python . 

However, I still can't solve the loop questions but I found that for the loop ones we could use "_for in_" or "_while in_" commands. 

Also there was a bug in my python exercises which I still couldn't find out why is that there was a "__type error__" which occurred in my coding n I thought it was because that the  python dictionary has no things like "_string_". This is a very complicated issue which made me unable to finish the following questions from exercise 2 so I got stuck. 

I finally found out the problem of why I couldn't get mark from the exercises and I figured out the idea of for in loops and started to change some problems for the exercise. :smiley:

  __Weekly notes for the exercises :__

 1. When writing the codes, always remember to `<return>` to have the code finished.
 
 2. __LOOPS__
    `<def loops_1a():>`
    """Make 10 stars.
    _Always need to make a list for the loop questions_
    `<a = []>` -- __use a square bracket to make a list__
    |
    __name for the list__ 

    `<for i in range (10):>`
        |
    __give a name to refer the string in the specific range i the list__
        `<a.append("*")>` "_append_ "
    `<return a>`
    
     :star: __"Every lists starts from 0__
    


   __Reading notes:__

   1.  __Entering the expressions into the interactive shell__ 

       Operator | Operation | Examples 
       --------- | ---------| --------
       ** | Exponent | 2 ** 3 = 8
       % | Remainder/ Modulus | 22 % 8 = 6
       // | Interger Division | 22 // 8 = 2
       / | Division | 22 / 8 = 2.75
   
   2. func `<input()>` is used to let people type in some strings when they run the code.
   
   3. __Comparison Operators :__
      
      Operator | Meaning 
      -------- | -------
      == | equal to 
      != | not equal to
