__WEEK 3 :__

1. __Lec notes :__

  1. __Syntax :__ `<in>`is really helpful for a _string_ .

  2. __Catching *Errors* :__ Use `<try catch>` statements to catch a error.

  3. __Elegance, Parsimony, Efficiency :__
    (find out the meaning of the three words)
    "Big O" --- worst case ( spending time to figure out the script)
2. idx = 0
   while idx < len(my_list)
   print(my_list[idx])
    idx = idx + 1

# _Exercises_

__Exercise 1__
At first, when I try to do exercise one I found that its a bit hard for me to do the loop question still. However after I went over some of the questions from week 2, I found that they are pretty similar so I just reapply some ideas to week3. 

For the first few questions I've learnt how to use the `<+=>` function, for example for the `<start += stop>`, it's basically means to increase a value with a specific `<step>` as the value could just being added with the value of the step. It simplify the way we coding with some loop and sequence problems.

I got stuck when I try to do the stubborn asker problem so I asked my friends about how to do that one and eventually did it.
* The intersting and useful techniques I've learnt is the `<format>` function which made coding much more easier.

__Exercise 3__
Exercise 3 is basically an advanced *guessing game* with the combination of the techniques we used in exe1 and 2. 
At first I couldn't figure out the logic of this one. but I found that it's pretty similar tot the *duct tape* problems we did before, with a clear logic and a bunch of `<if/elif>` functions.
In exercise 3, the func `<ValueError>` is used to response to the answer of the input value to see if is a wrong answer.

__Exercise 4__
Exercise four is about some mathematical problems but it's quite simple to code.
