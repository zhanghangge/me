#WEEK 4:
In this week we started to do the data analysis project base on the government's database.
And from the governments' websites I found that most of the dataset are pretty useful, 
so I think I'm going to find some datasets about the immigration of Australia in these years and make a comparison with the increasing rate of the economy to see if there is any relationships between them.

#Exercise
When I try to do the exercise of the json ones, I realise that we have to import json first before we do the _get detail_ exercises.
When we analyse some complicated files from online, we can use the read json web to make the codes readable.
