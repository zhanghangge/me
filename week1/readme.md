TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still uncle
#From this week I've stared to code by starting w commanding to print "Hello World"
#And get to know a little bit about coding in python..
1. **mkdir** = make direction : *make a new folder in a specific directory* 
2. **cd** = change directory : *change the directory to find the file/folder* 
3. use *"git clone + url"* to lone the url from github to use the file from github,
   fork the folder in order to use it as my own repo folder/file 
4. **dir** = *use dir command to find the location of the file/ also could be use to check if the file exists.*
5. Always **pull**  in every weeks to get the latest folder from git hub 
      and **push** to submit the exercises to my own repo
6. **Think-Test-Do-Save-Test-Commit-Push-Test**
   1. Test: To run the code either type (*python ../course/week1/tests.py*) in the terminal or debug it!
   2. use *trinket.io* to learn some coding ; results : *https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/e69e15c084*
