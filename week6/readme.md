__WEEK 6__
Lec
Using pandas (Jupyter(notebook)), to make a list of the files or sth.

__Machine Learning__
For the machine learning I tried to use the loop to do it with the control variables of elbow, ear and nose to let the computer recognise the gesture that the tester is doing.
So whenever somebody raise their hand above these ports of the body, the system will recognise it as <Hailing a taxi>.
